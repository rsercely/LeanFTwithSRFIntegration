# LeanFTwithSRFIntegration
This project is designed to provide an example of how to integrate LeanFT with SRF. Because of that, it is written against the public AOS website.

It has three branches:

* master - this is a branch after a simple recording
* withAM - an Application Model with a few objects was added
* ForSRF - code was added to support SRF execution. Note that there is a boolean defined, so this branch can run in SRF or Local
